# Examples

> ðŸš§ Not all topics are written yet and are a work in progress

From here, we will be covering specific topics in C3. These can range from common operations, to data structures and small projects. For most of these examples, we will slowly go over each part and then do a code dump at the end. If you're using a project to run these examples, you can use `c3c run` or `c3c build`. Otherwise you can compile and run a file with `c3c compile-run --run-once <thefile>.c3`.

Topics we will cover:
- [Using stdio](): reading and writing to the console with stdio
- [The Filesystem](): reading and writing files
