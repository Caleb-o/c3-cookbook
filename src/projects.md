This is a showcase of small projects you could create in C3. These examples are meant to serve as a "real world" usage of the language.

> For most of these examples, we will slowly go over each part and then do a code dump at the end. If you're using a project to run these examples, you can use `c3c run` or `c3c build`. Otherwise you can compile and run a file with `c3c compile-run --run-once <thefile>.c3`.

Projects:
- [TCP Server](): a basic echo TCP client and server
- [Writing an Allocator](): write a basic allocator that you can use to handle memory
- [Evaluating a basic expression](./projects/calculator.md): create a small parser and evaluator for a calculator
