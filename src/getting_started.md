*"C3 is a programming language that builds on the syntax and semantics of the C language, with the goal of evolving it while still retaining familiarity for C programmers."*

## About this book


> This book is being written with 0.6.x in mind. It may include nightly releases that have fixed problems with 0.6.2.
> If an example doesn't quite work with 0.6.2, try using the [latest](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/tag/latest) compiler.

This was inspired by the [Zig Cookbook](https://github.com/zigcc/zig-cookbook) which displays common and more idiomatic ways to use Zig around certain problems. I wanted to create a community driven book, that would do the same for C3. I believe it is something that can help developers pickup C3, as it provides another source to browse. 

I have used new languages where documentation and community driven media was scarce, which made it very hard to get an understanding of the language in a more practical manner. Hopefully this book can help with this issue and get some more people into C3.

Since I'm writing this as a newbie to C3, there are bound to be issues or better ways to achieve things.
