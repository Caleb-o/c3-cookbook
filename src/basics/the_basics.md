These examples are meant to get you started with C3, however, these will not be too in-depth around the whole language. For more detailed explanations of the language itself, you can visit [the official guide](https://c3-lang.org/guide/). This will cover only a few topics to help understand C3, but will not describe everything.

- [Hello World](hello_world.md): first program with details around its structure
- [Modules (WIP 🚧)](modules.md): small examples of how C3 uses modules
