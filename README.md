# c3-cookbook

This is a basic mdbook to provide examples of using [C3](https://c3-lang.org/). This is no way affiliated with the C3 project and is just a community project.

## Building

To build the docs run:
```sh
$ mdbook build --dest-dir docs
```

The docs will then be deployed onto github pages on commit.
